# Shidokan Website Readme
This site is one of our main company profile from Shidokan Kyokushin International Organization from Japan located in Indonesia.  This site is builded using pure programming code without using any website builder such as Wordpress Elementor etc, where we build through Fullstack from Front-End (HTML5, CSS3, JS Bootstrap, ReactJS) and Back-end (PHP, MySQL)<br><br>

Due to minimal information and sources from our client, we build the Shidokan Site using front-end _(still HTML5, CSS3, JS, and Bootstrap)_.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, this site will be implemented using ReactJS as time goes while learning advanced front-end to make this site more responsive, also start implement Backend that keeps instructor database and news using PHP and MySQL _(considering the small scale of our client's organization)_, also integrate one of our client's 'attendance application' he used to record student attendance.<br>
